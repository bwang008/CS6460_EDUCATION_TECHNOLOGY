Hi guys, my name is Ben and welcome to the channel practical data science.

This channel provides videos which are meant to be used as tools to help you learn and understand fundamental concepts in data science and statistics, while also providing
video demos on how to accomplish data related tasks.

The videos are designed to be self-starting so you can begin at any point and if there is anything that you don't understand, check out the description for links 
on resources, or ask a question in the comments. Don't be shy! We're all in this together.

Hope you have fun and I look forward to seeing you again in future videos!
