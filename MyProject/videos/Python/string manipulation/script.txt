Ok, this is going to be a quick video on how to work with strings in python.

This video is meant for beginners who are trying to get started in python and maybe you're trying to process some data so a couple of things I'll cover in this tutorial:

1. using stride to grab every X letter and reverse a string

2. finding and replacing substrings

3. finding and extracting substrings

4. splitting records in a string by a delimiter

5. How to look-up other commands with help

Strings are viewed as arrays and lists, and thus operations affecting these data types can easily be used on strings in python.

One quick way to reverse a string is to treat it like a reversed list so we'll use something called a stride.

For a string which I'll specify as testStr = "This is my string" 

So how do we reverse a string in python? The same way we reverse a list.

If I want to pass through all values in a list, I simply use testStr[::]
