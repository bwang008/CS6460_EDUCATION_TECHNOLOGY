In this video, I'll be showing you how to get started with working with images in python.

I'll be using jupyter notebook for my examples which comes with Anaconda. 

If you want to learn how to install Anaconda, I'll have a link to a tutorial in this
video's description. 

If you're interested in learning a little more about the technical details working with images in python, there is a video in my channel which goes through that.

Now let's get into it.

Here I have an image of a cat, and I'd like to read this cat image into my python program in order to do things with it.

The first thing we have to do is install a library for working with images because it doesn't come native to Anaconda.

Now let's open up the prompt and type this command:

conda install -y py-opencv

Once this is finished we can go onto the next step.

Part 2

So as you can see, I've created a jupyter notebook in the same directory as where my cat image is.

First I'll have to import my libraries:

import numpy as np
import cv2 as cv

That's all we're going to need in order to run this exercise.

Now let's first start by reading in my cat image.

Now let's display the cat image. This command here, waitKey(0) and destroyAllWindows(0) is just something you need to do with this library.

If you don't like typing that every time, you can create a function which does all of that for you.

Let's call this function display(window_name, image_path)

Cool, now let's cover a few simple operations like cropping an image and messing around with colors.
